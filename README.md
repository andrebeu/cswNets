# cswNets

Beginning this on 24 Oct 2018.
About to change CSW net simulations to simulate POMDP CSW where graph marker is fed at the beginning. 


X = [graph_marker, state(1), ... , state(T)]

Y = [state(1), state(2), ... , state(T-1), graph_marker]


The code might require small debugging before it is functional again. 

Saving and branching right after PDP talk. In this version, networks consume one story at a time, i.e. the cell state is zeroed out after each story.
