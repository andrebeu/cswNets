# cswNets

This is the version before PDP talk 24 Oct 2018. 
The code supports taking in one state at a time and predicting the next state. 
Cell state is zeroed out at the beginning of every story. 
There are two experiments here: 
  one where the cell receives a filler marker at each time step
  another where the cell never receives a filler marker.


The code might require small debugging before it is functional again.
